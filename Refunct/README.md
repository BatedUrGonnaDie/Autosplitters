# RefunctAutosplitter
Readme by @firestack
## Info
The autosplitter works by tracking how many buttons 
have been pressed so far. 
When you first start the game button count is 
equal to 0 so it won't automatically start splitting yet.
The button count variable we found changes on on section. 
Sometimes it takes 2-3 buttons to trigger the next section.
There are 31 sections so you'll need 31 splits.
[Bombmask has a splits file you can use on splits.io](https://splits.io/ojo).

The Autosplitter automatically starts the timer when you 
press reset after the first button has been pressed. 
So the autosplitter follows the rules for the game 
based on when you are supposed to start the timer.

## Instructions
- Start Livesplit
-- Ensure you have the autosplitter file loaded into livesplit
- Start Refunct
- Hit the first button
- Reset and start your run

When you reset the autosplitter doesn't save your times automatically 
(currently a livesplit ASL limitation?) so you need to reset/finish 
the run manually if you would like to keep your best times.

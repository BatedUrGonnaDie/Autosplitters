# RefunctAutosplitter
Readme by @firestack
## Info
The autosplitter works by tracking how many buttons 
have been pressed so far. 
When you first start the game button count is 
equal to 0 so it won't automatically start splitting yet.
The button count variable we found changes on on section. 
Sometimes it takes 2-3 buttons to trigger the next section.
There are 31 sections so you'll need 31 splits.
[Bombmask has a splits file you can use on splits.io](https://splits.io/ojo).

The Autosplitter automatically starts the timer when you 
press reset as long as you have gotten the first button.

## Instructions
- Start Livesplit
-- Ensure you have the autosplitter file loaded into livesplit
- Start Refunct
- Hit the first button
- Reset and start your run

When you reset the autosplitter doesn't save your times automatically 
(currently a livesplit ASL limitation?) so you need to reset/finish 
the run manually if you would like to keep your best times.

# Refunct Autosplitter
Readme by @firestack and @batedurgonnadie
## Info
Splitter tracks buttons hit.  Will start automatically on new game
and end on the last button.  Will reset the timer on new game selection as well.
Sample splits are included in this folder as well.

## Instructions
### Easiest (will update automatically)
- Start LiveSplit
- Start Refunct
- In LiveSplit, select the game "Refunct"
- Enable autosplitter for selected game

### Manually Downloading (will not update automatically)
- Start LiveSplit
- Start Refunct
- In layout, add autosplitter and point to .asl file you downloaded from here

After completing a run, the autosplitter cannot reset the splits if you have beaten best times.
Those need to be saved manually before the splitter will continue functioning.
This is a limitation of LiveSplit.
